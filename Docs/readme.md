## Website Description

The purpose of my website is to showcase my work and describe myself to a potential employer.  

The website contains my Tech Blog which was written to help pass on my knowledge to people new to tech.  

My target audience is employers looking to hire a coder either full time or casually to build their website etc.

## Tech Stack

The website primarily features HTML with CSS styling with a tiny bit of JS for the typewriter effect on the home page.  
It has been deployed with Netlify and the repo is stored on GitHub.  
I have created a slide show on powerpoint to display the build process. I used GEFORCE Experience to create a video presentation for the build which I uploaded on Youtube. I utilised Draw.io for the sitemap and Figma for my wireframes.
