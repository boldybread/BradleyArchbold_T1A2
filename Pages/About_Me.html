    <h1>About Me</h1>

    <p class="grey">
        I have a passion for health and fitness, I enjoy completing obstacle course races in my spare time, working out and playing touch footy. I love my Footy, my beloved Melbourne Storm are my team. I enjoy winding down playing video games or hanging out with my family.
        <br>
        I have been married since 2022 to Nicole, and we have a beautiful daughter Evie who keeps us on our toes!

    Employment History
    </h2>
    <p class="grey">
        In 2006 I started working for Coles supermarkets as a retail manager controlling various departments as well as the whole store at some points. I was responsible for managing about 100 team members to ensure sales targets were met and customer service was achieved.
        <br>   <br>
        I have worked the last 10 years in the RAAF as an Air Surveillance Operator where I have achieved the rank of Non-Commissioned Officer doing various roles such as Simulation Pilot, working with various radar & satelite surveillance systems and doing various humanitarian deployments. I have extensive experience in instructional, training development and assessing roles, including creating fundamental courses from the ground up and spearheading WING wide audits of training standards.

        <p class="grey">
        My passion has always been with computers, and for a few years I dabbled around with coding in my spare time, creating apps and websites here and there before deciding this is what I want to do. I decided to go back to studying and do my Diploma of Information Technology: Web Development. 
        <br>   <br>
        I am now embarking on the next stage of my employment journey as a full stack developer where I hope to help people and businesses fulfil their visions by creating robust platforms for them to get their product out to their target customer base.
